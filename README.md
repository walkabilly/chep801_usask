# CHEP 801.3: Epidemiology II	

This course is intended to build upon the foundational knowledge gained in CHEP 800 (Epidemiology) and CHEP 805 (Biostatistics) – building upon topics of bias, epidemiologic study design, inferential and descriptive statistics, and statistical model building. Course topics include: causation, bias, multivariable modelling, critical appraisal, study design, and “new” techniques in epidemiology (machine learning and predictive modelling). Methods of instruction will feature lectures and interactive lab sessions. Focus will be on the understanding of modern epidemiological practice and analytical skills in order to conduct independent public health practice and research. 

## Prerequisites
CHEP 800 (Epidemiology) or PUBH 800 (Epidemiology) AND CHEP 805 (Biostatistics I) or
PUBH 805 (Biostatistics I); or permission of the instructor

## Learning Outcomes
By the completion of this course, students will be able to

* Apply concepts of causal reasoning in epidemiology research, including the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs and a counterfactual approach.
* Critically assess epidemiological study design, analytical methods and results.
* Construct a research question, devise an appropriate study design and conduct data analyses
* Conduct appropriate data management and visualization activities
* Effectively communicate research findings, both orally and in writing
* Critically assess and apply modern epidemiologic methods, such as causal inference and machine learning, appropriately

## Course Data
In this course we will use the CanPath Student Dataset that provides students the unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with CanPath data. The CanPath Student Dataset is a synthetic dataset that was manipulated to mimic CanPath’s nationally harmonized data but does not include or reveal actual data of any CanPath participants.

The CanPath Student Dataset is available to instructors at a Canadian university or college for use in an academic course, at no cost. CanPath will provide the Student Dataset and a supporting data dictionary.

* Large sample size (Over 40,000 participants)
* Real-world population-level Canadian data
* Variety of areas of information allowing for a wide range of research topics
* No cost to faculty
* Potential for students to apply for real CanPath data to publish their findings
