## Data Viz

### 1. ggplot2 General

ggplot2 is an open-source data visualization package for the statistical programming language R. Created by Hadley Wickham in 2005, ggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphicsâ€”a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ggplot2)

Data viz is a big place where R and Stata diverge a lot. With R giving much more flexibility (and sometimes annoyance) in terms of visualizing data. We are going to cover basics but recommend the BBC Code Book [https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/) and Keiran Healey's book _Data Visualization_ [https://kieranhealy.org/publications/dataviz/](https://kieranhealy.org/publications/dataviz/) which is part of the the `socviz` package [https://kjhealy.github.io/socviz/](https://kjhealy.github.io/socviz/. )
