2. Add the `NUT_VEG_QTY` and the `NUT_FRUITS_QTY` to create one variable
    * Create a categorical variable that represents the recommended fruit and vegetable consumption per day

    * Low - < 600 MET minutes per week
    * Moderate - >=600 to <3000 MET minutes per week
    * High - >=3000 MET minutes per week
4. Calculate the mean and standard deviation
