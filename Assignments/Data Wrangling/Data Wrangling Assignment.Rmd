# Data Wrangling and Descriptive Statistics

## General instructions

You must submit the following. 

**Stata**

* Stata Log File
* Stata Do File
* Report in Word doc form with tables/figures cut and pasted from Stata output file

**R**

* RMarkdown file
* Knit report in HTML or PDF

## Part 1 - Explore the data 

1. Identify the variable types for each variable in the dataset
2. Recode and label categorical variables as necessary
2. Add the `NUT_VEG_QTY` and the `NUT_FRUITS_QTY` to create one variable
    * Create a categorical variable that represents the recommended fruit and vegetable consumption per day
3. Create a categorical variable for the `PA_TOTAL_SHORT` variable the defines low, moderate, and high activity per week
    * Low - < 600 MET minutes per week
    * Moderate - >=600 to <3000 MET minutes per week
    * High - >=3000 MET minutes per week
4. Calculate the mean and standard deviation
    * For the variables were it is appropriate
    * Including the new variables you have created
5. Calculate the percents and frequencies 
    * For the variables were it is appropriate to do so
6. Draw the histogram of continuous variables
    * Discuss the normality of the data 
7. Are there missing data? 
8. Are there outliers? 
9. Create a 2*2 table for fruit and vegetable consumption by gender
    * Interpret the 2*2 table result

## Part 2 - Format and Effort 

### General Formatting
- A combination sentences/paragraphs with some bullet points is appropriate.
- Include a list of references where appropriate. For this assignment, you do not need to worry
about providing references to the scales/items within the dataset.

### Overall
- Assignments will be evaluated based on the overall effort and thoroughness of the assignment, attention to details, and overall presentation of results.

## Data

In this course we will use the CanPath Student Dataset that provides students the unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with CanPath data. The CanPath Student Dataset is a synthetic dataset that was manipulated to mimic CanPathâ€™s nationally harmonized data but does not include or reveal actual data of any CanPath participants.
The CanPath Student Dataset is available to instructors at a Canadian university or college for use in an academic course, at no cost. 

* Large sample size (Over 40,000 participants)
* Real-world population-level Canadian data
* Variety of areas of information allowing for a wide range of research topics
* No cost to faculty
* Potential for students to apply for real CanPath data to publish their findings
