# Assignment 

In groups (groups will be assigned outside of Github) develop a 30minute presentation on an epidemiological problem of interest to your group. The purpose of the presentation is to provide a summary of the epidemiological evidence of your specific topic. You should use the concepts learned from this course and integrate knowledge about public health intervention. 

The audience for the presentation will be people with public health expertise including epidemiologists, health promotion experts, and medical health officers. 

A good way to think about this is using the concepts of types of public health evidence. You should also cover epidemiological concepts learned in the course including bias, causality, confounding, and effect modification, related to your topic. 

### Types of public health evidence

1. Type 1 evidence
    * Something should be done - Research that describes risk-disease relations, and identifies the magnitude, severity, and preventability of public health problems. 
2. Type 2 evidence
    * This should be done - Identifies the relative effectiveness of specific interventions aimed at addressing a problem.
3. Type 3 evidence
    * Information on the design and implementation of an intervention; the contextual circumstances in which the intervention was implemented; and information on how the intervention was received.
