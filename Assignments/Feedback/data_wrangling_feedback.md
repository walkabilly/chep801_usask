This file has generic feedback from assignment 1 from various iterations of this course. 

## 1. Markdown Code

Watch for spaces or lack of spaces. Your code should be clean and consistent. Review style guides

## 2. YAML

* Some people copied the code from the Github data work assignment. That’s fine… but be careful.
* Many had problems knitting because the YAML was not correct. 
* Best to start from scratch and type yourself. Knit as you go.

## 3. Outliers

Finding outliers is both a conceptual and data driven task. We are focusing on the conceptual here. For a given variable what is a reasonable number of consider an outlier? 

* How many Fruit and Vegetables a day would make me an outlier? 
* Most people made a boxplot. That’s great. 

## 4. Missing Data

Critical here. Need to think about missing by variable or by analysis (more on this later). 
Data is relatively clean but worse data will be hard to deal with.

## 5. Descriptive Tables

Many innovative solutions for this. Tyler contributed to and helps maintain the `reportRmd` package, which has a great function for descriptive tables.
