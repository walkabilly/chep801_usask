# Bias - Assignment 2 Feedback 

This file has generic feedback from assignment 2 from various iterations of this course. 

## 1. Interpretation

Try and interpret the RR or OR's for the assignment as if you were writing a paper or report. That is, interpret the exposure and outcome related to their hypothetical association and what a potential recommendation would be based on the RR or RR. In our case, we are talking about physical activity and diabetes. 

## 2. Significant

What out for the word `significant`. This has many meanings but in general we try and save it for statistical significance... if we must use statistical significance. 

## 3. Markdown Code

Work on formatting your markdown code. This takes some effort but will help you learn in the end. The best assignments clearly distinguish the questions from the answers and the answers are well formatted and easy to follow.
