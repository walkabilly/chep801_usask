# Epi Communication Assignment 1



# Assignment 

The following analysis uses the Can-Path Dataset available in Canvas.  

One of your biostatistician staff has conducted an analysis examining the association between different social and behavioural factors on Body Mass Index using the Can-Path dataset. Your goal as a epidemiologist is to use the analysis provided and develop a one page communication report/document to communicate the beginning of health promotion strategy for your region. You can write text, develop an infographic, and use outside knowledge to support the development of your report. You can also use figures or tables that are available in the analysis as part of the one page document. 

Example documents you could use for inspiration include: 

- [Canadaâ€™s Guidance on Alcohol and Health](https://ccsa.ca/canadas-guidance-alcohol-and-health)
- [Describing Epidemiologic Data](https://www.cdc.gov/eis/field-epi-manual/chapters/Describing-Epi-Data.html)
- [Using Social Determinants of Health Data to Generate Value](https://hitconsultant.net/2018/06/08/social-determinants-of-health-2/)
- [HIV Transmission from Mother to Child](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/digital-media/infographics/HIV-AIDS)

It is crucial when discussing obesity and weight status that we avoid adding to stigma as researchers and epidemiologists. There are a number of health consequences to weight stigma that we must attempt to avoid. At the same time, we need to work with people to try and improve health. Some resources here:
